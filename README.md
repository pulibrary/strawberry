# Strawberry
A repository for discussion of magazines, newspapers, journals, and other serial publications destined for the Figgy repository.

## Why Strawberry?
Strawberries are [stolons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolon "definition"), also known as runners: they are plants that propagate by forming adventitious roots at their nodes and new plants from buds.  The plants are therefore periodical.


## Vision
> Supporting [DLS's Vision](https://github.com/pulibrary/dls-handbook#our-vision), Strawberry will be a part of Princeton University's Digital Library particularly devoted to creating and sustaining an inspiring environment for global communities to engage with periodical literature: newspapers, magazines, and other serial publications.
